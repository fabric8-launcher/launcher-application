== Running the Booster on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster
If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can also deploy your booster there. A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer

$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME

$ ${OSORunCMD}
